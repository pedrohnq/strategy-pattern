# 🗒️ Let's get start
🚴 Imagine yourself as the owner of a delivery company that initially uses bicycles in a small town. As the company grows and expands to a larger city, the effectiveness of bicycle deliveries decreases due to greater distances between pickup and drop-off points. 

🤹‍♂️ Faced with this challenge, the need to incorporate other means of transportation, such as motorcycles, cars, and trucks, becomes evident. Even with these changes, the increase in delivery volume poses new challenges, leading to the implementation of specific strategies to meet various demands, including international deliveries. 

⚠️ The central reflection highlights the importance of a consistent strategic approach, adapting as needed for different types of deliveries.
